I currently work as a Data Engineer with expertise in designing scalable ETL pipelines, optimising cloud infrastructures and developing APIs that drive business solutions in the banking industry. 

I'm passionate about using technology to solve complex problems and drive innovation. Whether it's refining data workflows or building systems that empower decision-making, I find great satisfaction in creating solutions that make a tangible impact. Iâ€™m always eager to explore new tools and methodologies to stay ahead in the fast-paced tech landscape

Beyond work, I'm an avid listener of alternative rock music, enjoy having a hit on the tennis court and unwind in the evenings by watching a movie.
